The procedure is simple, we just create a feature vector for the fake artist and then we embed it with the other samples. This procedure also require that are specified one or more existing artist that are related to the fake one, in this way is possible to mix musical genres and see what are the recommended artists."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":30070,"status":"ok","timestamp":1666621023498,"user":{"displayName":"andrea giuseppe di francesco","userId":"08400322680190058161"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"5IpQhFw5ui1n","outputId":"b99cbfe1-64e9-4b52-a7da-df52818489b0"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["1.12.1\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","import torch\n","os.environ['TORCH'] = torch.__version__\n","print(torch.__version__)\n","import numpy as np\n","import plotly.express as px\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go\n","import json\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","from torchmetrics.functional import pairwise_euclidean_distance\n","from torch_geometric.nn import GATConv, SAGEConv\n","from torch.optim import lr_scheduler\n","import random\n","from random import choice,randrange\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\n","import math\n","import time\n","from torch_geometric import seed_everything\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","\n","random_seed=280085\n","\n","seed_everything(random_seed)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":307},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1135,"status":"error","timestamp":1666620903215,"user":{"displayName":"andrea giuseppe di francesco","userId":"08400322680190058161"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"hHgQQqZuWJ7f","outputId":"e8dac46c-69df-4a3d-e0e3-20660bca1dbb"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["1.12.1\n"]}],"source":["from architectures import *\n","from utils import *"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"Agyg6OT-x2Es"},"outputs":[],"source":["device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QjCLttrhbBCF"},"source":["With the help of the [Torch geometric framework](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was really easy to handle the graph attributes and nodes and then the training of the GNNs."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2507,"status":"ok","timestamp":1666187629692,"user":{"displayName":"andrea giuseppe di francesco","userId":"08400322680190058161"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"EEnPYRB2ulHt","outputId":"1a1f7594-e890-412a-9688-04c402cb62c2"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["11261\n"]}],"source":["X = torch.load('instance').T.to(device)      # Instance matrix\n","A = torch.load('adjacencyCOO').to(device)    # Adjacency matrix in the COO format, that is that supported by torch geometric\n","A1 = torch.load('adjacency').to(device)      # Normal adjacency matrix format is obtained with torch.load('adjacency')\n","num_samples = X.shape[0]\n","print(num_samples)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["''' These variables contain the information about the artists' names, and their position in the dataset, this makes easy to look for their name and to better draw conclusions at inference time '''\n","num2artist = load_data('dizofartist.json')\n","artist2num = {num2artist[key]:key for key in num2artist}\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Bb5TJKAb4oW5"},"source":["##### Data in the dataset corrensponds to a set of artist, we have stored their names in two dictionaries.
